# laminas-dependency-plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/laminas/laminas-dependency-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/laminas/laminas-dependency-plugin)

This Composer plugin, when enabled in a project, intercepts requests to install
packages from the zendframework and zfcampus vendors, and will replace them with
the equivalents from the Laminas Project.

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require laminas/laminas-dependency-plugin
```
